Unlike the imperative paradigm, the logic paradigm focuses on the **“what” part** of the problem rather than **how** to solve it. All you need to specify is **what** needs to be solved, and the program determines the algorithm to solve it. 

### Key Characteristics of the Logic Paradigm

1. **Focus on Problem Description**:
   - The programmer describes the problem as closely as possible.
   - The algorithm is of less importance to the programmer.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - A program consists of:
     - **Axioms**: A collection of facts and inference rules that form a theory.
     - **Goal Statement**: A theorem to be proven using deductions within the theory.

3. **Use of Relations**:
   - Logic programming is based on the mathematical concept of a **relation** from set theory.
   - A relation is defined as a **subset** of the Cartesian product of two or more sets.

### Example: Relations in Logic Programming

#### Sets and Cartesian Product

Suppose we have two sets:
- `Person = {John, Li, Ravi}`
- `Nationality = {American, Chinese, Indian}`

The Cartesian product of these sets, denoted as `Person x Nationality`, is:

```plaintext
Person x Nationality = {
    {John, American}, {John, Chinese}, {John, Indian},
    {Li, American}, {Li, Chinese}, {Li, Indian},
    {Ravi, American}, {Ravi, Chinese}, {Ravi, Indian}
}
```
#### Defining a Relation

A **relation** is a subset of the Cartesian product. For example:
``` plaintext
PersonNationality = {
    {John, American},
    {Li, Chinese},
    {Ravi, Indian}
}
```

Here, each element in the relation is a **tuple**.

#### Goal Statement

In logic programming, the `PersonNationality` relation can be used as a collection of **facts**. You can state a **goal statement** (or problem) like this:

```plaintext
PersonNationality(?, Chinese)
```

This statement means: “Give me all the names of people who are Chinese.”  
The program will search through the `PersonNationality` relation and extract the matching tuples.

**Answer**: The result will be `Li`.

### Example of a Logic Programming Language

- **Prolog**: A programming language that supports the logic paradigm.

### Summary of the Logic Paradigm

- The logic paradigm focuses on **describing the problem**, not the steps to solve it.
- Programs are built using facts (axioms) and goal statements (problems to solve).
- Solutions are derived using **deduction**.
- The approach is highly declarative, abstracting the computational process.
