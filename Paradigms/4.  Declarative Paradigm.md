# Declarative Paradigm

In the declarative paradigm, a program consists of the **description of a problem**, and the computer finds the solution. The program does not specify **how** to arrive at the solution to the problem. It is the computer’s job to arrive at a solution when a problem is described to it.

### Imperative vs. Declarative Paradigm

- **Imperative Paradigm**: Focuses on the “how” part of the problem (how to solve it).
- **Declarative Paradigm**: Focuses on the “what” part of the problem (what the problem is).

### Subtypes of the Declarative Paradigm

- **Functional Paradigm**
- **Logic Paradigm**

These are specialized approaches within the declarative paradigm.

### Example: Database Query in SQL

Writing a database query using **Structured Query Language (SQL)** is an example of programming based on the declarative paradigm. In SQL, you specify **what data** you want, and the database engine determines **how** to retrieve it.

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM users WHERE age > 30;
```

In this example:

- You describe the desired data (`name` and `age` of users over 30).
- The database engine figures out how to retrieve it.

### Key Characteristics of the Declarative Paradigm

1. **Data vs. Algorithm**:
    
    - In the **imperative paradigm**:
        - Data is **transient** (modified as the algorithm executes).
        - The algorithm is **permanent**.
    - In the **declarative paradigm**:
        - Data is **permanent** (supplied as input and remains unchanged).
        - The algorithm is **transient** (produces new data without modifying the input).
2. **Side Effects**:
    
    - In the declarative paradigm, execution of an algorithm does **not produce side effects**.


### **Functional Programming Languages**

These languages focus on immutability and function composition, avoiding state changes and side effects.

- **Haskell**
- **Erlang**
- **Elixir**
- **Scala** (can also be imperative)
- **F#**
- **Lisp** and its derivatives like **Clojure** and **Scheme**
### Summary

In the declarative paradigm:

- You focus on describing the **problem**.
- The computer takes responsibility for finding the **solution**.
- The execution process is abstracted away, allowing you to concentrate on **what** needs to be achieved rather than **how** to achieve it.
